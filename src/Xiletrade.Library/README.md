### Scalability
* This library is currently undergoing remodeling and will be simplified in a next release. Will be published as Nuget.
* Models will be enriched and services will be preferred over static classes.

### Client Logs
For now and likely to change : To limit read/write disk access, Xiletrade does not use any log system to track down non-blocking errors or feature behaviours.
A service is used to show message box for each use case encountering possible known blocking errors or unknown exceptions associated with a complete log file under root directory.

### Consider to contribute :
This library is developed in self-taught. [Github Issues](https://github.com/maxensas/xiletrade/issues) reports system is used to track down bugs and bad features behaviours.
