# Developer

## Rules to follow for this project
* Make sure to follow the code style followed throughout the project.
* Each new feature must be developed as a service, no static class. Either by enriching the main library if it does not bring new dependencies or by creating a new one.
* To be accepted, any big feature or change should be discussed first on discord with the maintainer of the project.
