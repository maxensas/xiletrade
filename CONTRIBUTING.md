git checkout -b feature/NewFeature
```
- Make your changes

Run and validate your code in your personal repo

- Commit properly:

## 🧼 Code Style

This project uses C#, an object-oriented programming language with advanced technical concepts commonly used in 
**IT services** (industrial and tertiary sectors) to enhance projects **readability**, **maintainability** and improve collaborative work.

Please **respect** general C# conventions and adapt your work to the code style used.

## 📚 .NET References

Using **DI** implementation and **MVVM** pattern with **XAML** frameworks:
- [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)
- [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/MVVM-Samples)

Using **archive** utility:
- [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress)

Using **parsing** algorithm:
- [Fastenshtein](https://github.com/DanHarltey/Fastenshtein)

**Stick to the goal:** make the application with a low level of dependency on third-party references but also avoid reinventing the wheel when implementing new ideas.

## 🛠️ New features

- Must be developed as a **service** and injected. Either by enriching the main library if it does not bring new dependencies or by creating a new one.
- To be pushed, any **big feature** or **change** should be discussed first on **discord** with the maintainer of the project.
- Must follow the [rules set by GGG](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/index#policy) if that need to interact with the game or will be rejected.
